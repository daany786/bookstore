    <h1> Our <span>Journey</span></h1>
     
    <p>It was in spring of 2015 that our teacher grouped us together for a book reading activity.It was the same day we realized that we all shared the same strong passion for books. The realization that people out there didn't have access to books and couldn't enjoy reading was a hard pill to swallow for us.Therefore,when we opened our online book store, we made vows to ourselves to ensure that we helped as many people as we could.We started with a limited amount of books in our inventory, and we had to continuously ask for donations from our fellows.But over time,our collection grew and so did we. We established firm ground rules to benefit others.Quickly enough, our collection grew to include books of multiple genres. We're proud to state that we were involved in the distribution of books to countless people and allowed them to find and read books they loved.</p>
